		h1.title ABOUT US
		p The William P. Clements Junior Engineering Technical Society (JETS) is a science and engineering club focusing on three main competitions: Science Olympiad, Science Bowl, and TEAMS. Our goal each competition season is to place first in each of those three competitions and be successful in the national competitions, as well as promote science and engineering in our community.

				h2 Science Olympiad
				p Teams of 15 students compete in 23 different science-based events, from Materials Science to Astronomy. Five of these events are building-intensive events, where students construct projects such as bridges and robotic arms. Science Olympiad stresses teamwork: all events require teams of 2 or more, and qualification to State and Nationals is by team.

				h2 TEAMS
				p TEAMS is a question-essay based competition based on applying engineering concepts to a specific field, such internet security. Eight people work together to complete 100 multiple choice questions and write essays on specific scenarios that they have familiarized themselves with. We send 2 underclassmen and 2 upperclassmen teams.
