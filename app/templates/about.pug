				h2 Science Olympiad
				p Teams of 15 students compete in 23 different science-based events, from Materials Science to Astronomy. Five of these events are building-intensive events, where students construct projects such as bridges and robotic arms. Science Olympiad stresses teamwork: all events require teams of 2 or more, and qualification to State and Nationals is by team.
